# Tata Sky m3u generator web app
A react web app to generate an m3u playlist for the channels subscribed on Tata Sky.
## Update
Converted to a single repo to make it a one click deploy on vercel as a lot of you non-technical people were facing difficulties while deploying.
## Deploy on vercel and access from anywhere (Easy)
1) Click the button below to deploy.<br>
<a href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/saifshaikh1805/tata-sky-m3u.git"><img src="https://vercel.com/button" alt="Deploy"/></a><br>
You will need an account on Vercel. It's free!
2) Enjoy!
## Run locally (You need a little bit of git and npm knowledge)
1) Clone this repo.
2) Open cmd / terminal and type the below commands one by one.<br>
a) npm install<br>
b) npm run dev
3) Enjoy!

Once you generate the m3u URL, you don't need to do it every 24 hours. It will automatically generate fresh JWT on every request.
